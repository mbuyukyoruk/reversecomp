        reversecomp help:

This script is developed to get reverse complementary of sequences in a multifasta/fasta file.

SeqIO package from Bio is required to fetch flank sequences. Additionally, tqdm is required to provide a progress bar since some multifasta files can contain long and many sequences.
        
Syntax:

        python reversecomp.py -i demo.fasta

reversecomp dependencies:
